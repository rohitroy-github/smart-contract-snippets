# Smart Contract Snippets

A project by to showcase quick solidity smart contract snippets.

## Description

This repository contains a collection of simple Solidity smart contracts implemented using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment. The goal of this project is to provide concise examples of various Solidity contracts for educational purposes and quick reference.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hardhat-simple-storage-fcc.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

cd hardhat-simple-storage-fcc

3. Install the project dependencies:

npm install

## Usage

Running Tests
You can run the provided tests for the Solidity contracts using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Compiling Contracts
To compile the Solidity contracts in the contracts/ directory, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run compile
Deploying Contracts
You can deploy contracts to a local Hardhat network or a live Ethereum network. Modify the deployment script in scripts/deploy.js as needed and then use the following command to deploy:

bash
Copy code
npm run deploy
Verifying on Etherscan
To verify your contract on Etherscan, use the following command (replace <network-name> and <contract-address> with your specific values):

bash
Copy code
npm run etherscan-verify --network <network-name> <contract-address>
Code Coverage
Generate code coverage reports for your tests using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run coverage
